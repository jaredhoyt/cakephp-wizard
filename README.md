# CakePHP Wizard Plugin

The Wizard plugin for CakePHP automates several aspects of multi-page forms including data persistence, form preparation and unique data processing, wizard resetting (manual and automatic), user navigation, and plot-branching navigation while maintaining flexibility with custom validation and completion callbacks.

## Installation

* Include the wizard component in your controller:
   * `public $components = array('Wizard.Wizard');`
